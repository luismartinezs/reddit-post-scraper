Title: suggest places to move to for "healthy" lifestyle Content: - amazing gym facilities - affordable apartments no more than 1k$/month (local rental prices, not Airbnb which tends to be about double price) - nice weather - good amount of outdoor / sporty meetups and events that make it easy to meet people - nice nature - easy groceries, home delivery - good internet On the other hand, I don't care at all about nightclubs, nightlife, drinking places and all that What would be the best place in the world for this? Medellin is great for everything you mentioned, but Spanish is kind of a requirement if you want to speak to anyone at all down there. Like what is that? Not something I personally would do, but I also don't work out for my job saito200(11): In practice all I do is work at home, go to the gym and join sporty activities on the weekend to meet people who are into health and wellness as opposed to your typical "let's hang out and have a beer". Many good restaurants if you don't have time to cook. Rent is usually less than 400$ a month, very healthy food options and especially a lot of cheap meat/seafood for carnivores, home delivery, internet depends on the location but should be 5-100mb/s and its cheap. Are you into that or do you want to feel like you’re in a bigger city? That isn't even to mention the Thai food which is great. I want to go back as I feel like I missed so much hiking because I didn't know it was such a good hiking destination. I’m not sure about the gym scene, but it checks all your other boxes.
